Maker.js is all about creating line drawings for two dimensional maker machines, like laser cutters and CNC routers. Using the Maker.js JavaScript library, a developer may create a small program that creates a line drawing. The program can accept parameters which can be used to alter the drawing. The program can be shared and re-used in other drawings.

Maker.js is an open source project created by the [Microsoft Garage](microsoft.com/garage) and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/Microsoft/maker.js).

It can run in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) environment or in your web browser.

Sharing happens on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=makerjs).
