Maker.js creates line drawings for two dimensional maker machines, like laser cutters and CNC routers. Using the Maker.js JavaScript library, a developer may create a small program that creates a line drawing. The program can accept parameters which can be used to alter the drawing. The program can be shared and re-used in other drawings. Lastly, the drawing can be exported to a file in either DXF or SVG format. The file can then be used directly by a maker machine, uploaded to a maker service, or imported into other CAD software.

Services that make actual stuff from drawings:

| Service | File format |
|---|---|
| [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/)  | SVG or DXF |
| [Big Blue Saw](http://www.bigbluesaw.com/) | DXF |
| [eMachineShop](http://www.emachineshop.com/) | DXF |
