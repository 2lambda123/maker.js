title: Units
---

<p>Until now we have been using examples with values like 50 and not specifying units. 
Our examples were Unitless and that is just fine for abstract models. When you need to specify the units you can use
<b>makerjs.unitType</b> which has these properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Centimeter</li>
  <li>Foot</li>
  <li>Inch</li>
  <li>Meter</li>
  <li>Millimeter</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties are case sensitive. They contain the values "cm", "foot", "inch", "m" and "mm" respectively. 
It is your choice whether to use the named property or the string value directly.</p>
