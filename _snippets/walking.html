title: Walking a model tree
---

<p>
    A model is a tree structure which may contain paths, and it may also contain other models in a recursive fashion.
    You can traverse the entire tree by calling <a href="/maker.js/docs/api/modules/makerjs.model.html#walk">makerjs.model.walk</a> with your model and an options object which specifies callbacks:
</p>

<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
