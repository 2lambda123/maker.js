title: Path independence
---

<p>
In Maker.js, path objects are not continuous to one another. Of course your paths will typically connect point-to-point both visually
and mathematically, but Maker.js does not have a notion of their connection. This gives the programmer great freedom,
especially when modifying paths in external models.
</p>

<p>Example: these paths "connect"</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var makerjs = require('makerjs');

var model = { 
  paths: {
    "v": new makerjs.paths.Line([0, 0], [0, 100]),
    "h": new makerjs.paths.Line([0, 0], [100, 0]),
    "arc":new makerjs.paths.Arc([0, 0], 100, 0, 90)
  }
};

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(model);

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
When a maker machine uses your drawing, the machine's print driver will usually sort the paths prior to printing so that lines are cut continuously when they are connected point to point.
