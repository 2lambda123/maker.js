title: Open vs Closed Geometry
---

<p>
    Maker.js works with both open and closed geometries. However as we will soon see, with closed geometries there is additional functionality.
</p>

<p>
    We briefly discussed <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/maker.js/docs/basic-drawing/#Path%20independence%20and%20Chains">chains and endless chains</a>,
    now we will see how they relate to open and closed geometries.
</p>

Examples of Open Geometry:
<ul>
    <li>A solitary line path.</li>
    <li>A solitary arc path.</li>
    <li>A chain of paths (with dead ends).</li>
</ul>

{% highlight javascript %}
//an asterisk shape that is not a closed geometry

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

function asterisk() {

  function plus() {
    this.paths = {
      h: new makerjs.paths.Line([-5, 0], [5, 0]),
      v: new makerjs.paths.Line([0, -5], [0, 5])
    }
  }

  this.models = {
    plus: new plus(),
    plus1: makerjs.model.rotate(new plus(), 45)
  };
}

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new asterisk());

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

Examples of Closed Geometry:
<ul>
    <li>A circle path.</li>
    <li>An endless chain of paths.</li>
    <li>Any of the above, nested within another and not overlapping.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/maker.js/docs/basic-drawing/#Basic%20models">house, tablet mount, circular adapter plate, and skateboard deck</a> are good examples of a closed geometry.
    They have nested endless chains (such as circles, squares, or rounded rectangles).
    If you were to print them on a laser cutter, you would have a complete shape.
