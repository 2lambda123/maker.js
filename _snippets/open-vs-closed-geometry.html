title: Open vs Closed Geometry
---

<p>
Maker.js works with both open and closed geometries. Let's start with an example of an open geometry:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//render a model with paths that form an open geometry

var makerjs = require('makerjs');

var model = { 
  paths: {
    "v": new makerjs.paths.Line([0, 0], [0, 100]),
    "h": new makerjs.paths.Line([0, 0], [100, 0]),
    "arc":new makerjs.paths.Arc([0, 0], 100, 0, 90)
  }
};

var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(model);

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
When a maker machine uses your drawing, the machine's print driver will usually sort the paths prior to printing so that lines are cut continuously when they are connected point to point.
