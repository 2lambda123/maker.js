<p>
    Bezier curves are a fascinating and complex topic too large to cover here, it is recommended that you visit <a href="http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">A Primer on Bézier Curves</a> by <a href="">Mike Kamermans (aka Pomax)</a>.
    Maker.js depends on Pomax's <a href="http://pomax.github.io/bezierjs/">Bezier.js</a> which is another important site to visit fo understanding Bezier curve functionality in depth.
