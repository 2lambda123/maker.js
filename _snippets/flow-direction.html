title: Flow direction of paths
---

<p>
    The three types of paths in Maker.js are line, arc and circle. A circle has no end points, and therefore cannot
    connect to other paths to form a chain. Lines and arcs however, may connect to other lines or arcs at their end
    points to form chains. In context of a chain, lines and arcs each have a concept of a directional flow:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>line - a line flows from its origin to its end.</li>
    <li>arc - an arc flows from its startAngle to its endAngle, in the polar (counter-clockwise) direction.</li>
</ul>
