title: Path constructors
---

<p>
In the example code above we used plain old JavaScript objects to create paths and models. 
Notice that we didn't need to use a special constructor provided by Maker.js to create either a path or a model.
This is an intentional aspect of Maker.js, that you can decide how to create your objects.
To make these plain objects work with Maker.js, they needed to use the property names specified above.

<p>
We also illustrated 3 ways of defining an object: using a var, using a function that returns a var, 
and using a constructor function (for use by the <b>new</b> keyword). Let's convert our simple line path into a constructor function.
