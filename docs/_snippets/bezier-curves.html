title: Bezier curves
---

<p>
    Bezier curves are a fascinating and complex topic too large to cover here, it is recommended that you visit <a href="//pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">A Primer on Bezier Curves by Mike Kamermans (aka Pomax)</a>.
    Maker.js depends on Pomax's <a href="//pomax.github.io/bezierjs/">Bezier.js</a> which is a vital site to visit for understanding Bezier curve functionality in depth.
</p>

<h4>Bezier curves: from wild to mild</h4>

<p>
    The central idea of Maker.js is to break a drawing up into small, reasonable primitives such as lines circles and arcs. 
    These primitives have a monotonic nature which make them easy to understand when it comes to bounding box and intersection calculation.
    Bezier Curves may make these operations more difficult, since they can potentially represent some "wild" shapes 
    such as loops, sharp corners, or S shapes that are not monotonic in both x and y dimensions. But they can also represent "mild" shapes 
    which resemble circular arcs, with a monotonic shape that is more predictable.
</p>

<p>
    The representation of a Bezier curve in Maker.js is a model containing a series of "mild" curves which are divisions of the original curve.
</p>
<p>
    To create a Bezier Curve, call <a href="/docs/api/classes/makerjs.models.beziercurve.html#content">makerjs.models.BezierCurve</a> with the <b>new</b> operator. 
    You can create both quadratic and cubic Bezier curves.
</p>

<p>
    Create a quadratic Bezier curve in by passing an array of three points - an origin point, a control point, and an end point:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//create a quadratic Bezier curve

var m = require('makerjs');

var points = [[0, 100], [0, 0], [100, 0]];

var curve1 = new m.models.BezierCurve(points);
curve1.origin = [20, 20];

//more accurate
var curve2 = new m.models.BezierCurve(points, 0.01);

var model = {
  models: {
    c1: curve1, c2: curve2
  }
};

var svg = m.exporter.toSVG(model);

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<hr />

<p>
    Create a cubic Bezier curve in by passing an array of four points - an origin point, a first control point (relating to the origin point), a second control point (relating to the end point), and an end point:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
//create a cubic Bezier curve

var m = require('makerjs');

var points = [[0, 0], [50, 50], [50, -50], [100, 0]];

var curve1 = new m.models.BezierCurve(points);
curve1.origin = [0, 20];

//more accurate
var curve2 = new m.models.BezierCurve(points, 0.1);

var model = {
  models: {
    c1: curve1, c2: curve2
  }
};

var svg = m.exporter.toSVG(model);

document.write(svg);
{% endhighlight %}

<script>
    LiveDoc.evalLastCode();
</script>

<p>
    Play these examples, then click "show path names" to see the "mild" curves representing the overall curve.

<h4>Bezier Curves represented with circular arcs</h4>

<p>
    In Maker.js version previous of 0.18.0, Bezier Curves were represented 
    as a model containing a series of circular arc paths which closely approximate the curve.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve the previous behavior, Call <a href="/docs/api/classes/makerjs.models.beziercurveasarcs.html#content">makerjs.models.BezierCurveAsArcs</a> with the <b>new</b> operator. 
    You can create both quadratic and cubic Bezier curves. For either type, you may optionally pass the accuracy - 
    the maximum distance between the true curve and the arc approximations.
    Closer approximation means more calculation time and more arcs.
    The default accuracy coefficient in Maker.js will produce an accurate and visually smooth curve in a reasonable calculation timeframe.
